# A Simple Version of TensorFlow Implementation of the Transformer: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762>

This project is originally forked from <https://github.com/Kyubyong/transformer>.
Some core code is taken from <https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor>.

## Highlight Features
- Data processing with bucket mechanism. This allow higher utilization of computational resources.
- Beam search that supporting batch input.
- Using yaml to config all hyper-parameters, as well as other settings.
